# Summative - One Tweet

The project that I’ve decided to present is One Tweet.

I wanted to present this one as I feel it’s the one that I have learnt a lot from and have developed the designs from my initial ideas.

When we were given this project I created the first five designs that I thought of with no thought behind them so I didn’t have much reasoning behind them. 

For all of my initial designs I looked at what imagery would relate to the tweet but that was it. 

* For this one I had the idea of a megaphone projecting the tweet so that’s what I did. I didn’t think about the colour used, the spacing or the font. I just wanted a gradient to represent it getting louder.

*  This design I didn’t think about spacing but I thought more about the colour and font, relating it to Edward Snowden in the C.I.A with the corporate font with the colour to match the badge. I used the ear cut out to directly relate to the tweet.

*  Again, for this design I didn’t think at all about the colour and the meaning of the colour used. I wanted this to represent the sound waves of a cartoon megaphone but I found it looked too much like a 2D christmas tree.

* This design didn’t completely fit the brief as it has the image of the ear in it so I planned to have the ear made up of text without any image for my final design.

* I wanted to create a design that created a full picture and came up with this. However, apart from the tweet and the headphone it doesn’t really link to the tweet. The reasoning I had behind the type was for it to stand out and be bold.

###For my final ideas I wanted to develop them further based on what my initial ideas were lacking.


So I looked into the psychology of colour, the meaning behind my designs, choosing fonts that link into my ideas and also implementing visual perception principles.


* Colour: used a gradual gradient to visualise someone saying the tweet and it getting louder. I chose turquoise to represent communication and clarity. Meaning: I included the use of white space as I wanted the design to have ‘room to breathe’ making it look more appealing. VPP: The VPP I used is repetition.

* Colour: I kept the same colour scheme as I had in my original design (C.I.A badge). Typography: used is bold to get the message across that he is frustrated or shouting to be heard. Meaning: What springs to mind when the tweet is heard is an ear so I cut out a shape of an ear but not too large that you can’t read the tweet. VPP: I have used repetition in this design to show anger of being heard.

* VPP: I used repetition, continuation and symmetry to show the look of sound waves. Used Continuation to represent the fact that the tweet is a rhetorical question so there may not be an answer like this design doesn’t have an end. Colour: I chose gold for the main colour as it represents success and triumph which can be shown by the sound wave getting louder and someone hearing.

* Colour: The idea behind the colour used is the same as my second design (C.I.A). The typography links to the same reason - it has a very corporate look to it to portray him better. VPP: I used repetition to create the effect you may see in a magazine with the interviewee’s image in the centre with all the questions behind it. I also used repetition of the tweet to create the image of the ear and headphone to visualise the tweet.

* I created E.S out of his tweet. VPP: By using repetition I created his face and features out of just the tweet. Colour: I used orange as it is the colour of social communication which is linked more with where the tweet came from. But it is also the colour of optimism which links to the tweet itself with getting an answer.
